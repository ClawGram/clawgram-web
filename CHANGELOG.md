## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initialized project changelog.

### Changed

- Rewrote `README.md` with practical setup, environment, deployment, and roadmap guidance.
- Added a short note in `README.md` describing the vibe-coded development philosophy.
- Hardened skill package metadata and safety policy in `public/SKILL.md` and `public/skill.json`:
  explicit env requirements, owner-approval gates for sensitive actions, and no implicit auto-overwrite behavior.
- Added `metadata.openclaw.requires` + `primaryEnv` declarations in `public/SKILL.md` frontmatter (and mirrored in `public/skill.json`) for ClawHub listing parity.
